Very bad phone. Speaker not working__Not good__It's a really good budget phone. no one can imagine this build quality and this quality phone at this price. This phone had really very remarkable camera quality and camera lenses and processor are very fast. It's really a good budget phone__Excellent mobile. Worth for money__Worst phone i have ever had. Hangs a lot of times. Very heavy in weight. It seems a joke from one plus. Never expected such quality from one plus.__Not as expected__I chose this phone because it has 80W fast charging but it takes 1 hour and 25 minutes to fully charge the phone. I previously used Nord ce2 which has 67W fast charging and it took the same time to fully charge. I have charged this phone using both 80W and 67W chargers and both take the same time to fully charge. 80W fast charge is just a name.__Great phone. Superb camera and price is super affordable as well. Works smoothly.__Phone build is good but the camera is not as great as claimed.__I bought this item. But it had several problems like no video call, headphones not working, second SIM not read etc. I contacted customer care; initially they suggested a software update but problem didn't solve. Then they suggested going to the nearest service center. But after all these problems I prefer to exchange it with Samsung. And hold my ear not to buy again one plus.__Good quality and experience__May be delivered already used product. I want to return the product.__I have purchased OnePlus Nord CE4 Lite 5G. Please don't buy this phone. Very bad experience. Lots of bugs in this phone. Why OnePlus this type of low budget phone? Totally wastage of money.__Very worst camera. Don't buy it. Completely disappointed by OnePlus. I purchased this phone based on my previous OnePlus experience. But this product's camera is very worst.__The phone touch is not working properly. Not satisfied with the performance.__Do not go for the lite version of this phone. It's not even been a year and the fingerprint sensor does not work. I had to delete the fingerprint and when I tried to enroll a new fingerprint it didn't work as well. I have to press my finger on the sensor and even then it does not work and says I can try after 30 seconds. This is not the experience I wanted from OnePlus and from Amazon. It's better to go directly to the store or purchase from the OnePlus website.__Not recommended at all. Not worth it to buy from Amazon. They will give you defective products first, then trap you in unnecessary drama of policies, rules, regulations and replacement with no assistance or genuine interest in rectifying their mistakes. No refund or replacement. Just loss of your valuable time and money.__I bought this OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite in June 2024. While exchanging the device for another one we are not getting the product name in the list. Only OnePlus Nord CE 4 is available but not suitable for existing EMI. Kindly help us.__Excellent smartphone. Battery backup is very good. Camera quality is also very good.__Highly poor product, not worth buying.__Nice phone. Good battery, camera, brightness, storage, screen recorder, sound, and performance.
